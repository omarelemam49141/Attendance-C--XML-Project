# Attendance Management System

## Project Overview
The Attendance Management System is a desktop application designed to automate the attendance tracking process for organizations. The system allows users to record and manage attendance data, validate it against a predefined schema using XML Schema (XSD), and generate reports through XSLT transformations.

## Key Features
### User Authentication
- Users must log in with valid credentials to access the system.
- Different user roles (Admin, Teacher, Student) with corresponding permissions.

### Attendance Recording
- Teachers can mark attendance for each student in their class.
- Students can view their own attendance records.

### XML Data Storage
- Attendance data is stored in XML format.
- Each attendance record contains information such as student ID, date, and attendance status.

### XML Schema Validation
- Define and load an XML Schema (XSD) for validating the attendance data.
- The system ensures that recorded attendance adheres to the specified schema.

### Attendance Reporting
- Generate attendance reports for individual students, classes, or a specific date range.
- Reports can be viewed within the application or exported to external formats (PDF, Excel).

### User Interface (UI)
- Clear and intuitive UI for ease of use.
- Separate interfaces for Admin, Teacher, and Student with role-specific functionalities.

### Error Handling
- Implement robust error handling for scenarios such as invalid login credentials, data input errors, etc.
- Provide informative error messages to guide users.

### File Management
- Save and load attendance data from XML files.
- Automatic backup of attendance data at regular intervals.

### Preferences
- Allow customization of preferences such as date formats, language, etc.

### Documentation
- User manual explaining system usage and features.
- Include a README file with installation instructions and any prerequisites.

### Testing
- Comprehensive testing plan covering unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests.
- Generate sample XML data for testing different attendance scenarios.

### Deployment
- Create an installer for easy deployment on Windows systems.

## Technologies Used
- C# (Windows Forms)
- XML
- XSD (XML Schema Definition)
- XSLT (XML Style sheet Language)

## Conclusion
The Attendance Management System aims to streamline attendance tracking for educational institutions. By adhering to these specifications, the system should offer a reliable and user-friendly solution for managing attendance records through XML-based data storage, validation, and transformation.
